### DEMO MonitoringDemo: p2p, Spatial Network, Sensors, Monitoring GUI

To execute the system, simply run (in any order):
- MonitoringDemoMain1
- MonitoringDemoMain2
Each main program will start a subsystem according to configuration.

To observe and control the system, simply run:
- MonitoringDemoMonitor

You should expect the system to execute a channel program, showing the output of every device in the monitoring GUI.
You can interact with the GUI to:
- Change the values of each sensor of the devices. In this way, a device can be set as source, destination or obstacle
  for the channel program. Once set source and destination, you should expect the system to stabilize, showing the
  shortest path from source to destination.
- Move the devices across the net and see how the system reacts.
